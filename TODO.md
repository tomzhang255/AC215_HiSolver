# TODO

- FIXME PRIORITY: directory restructure - put secrets folder outside of src - write docker-shell.sh and docker-entrypoint.sh for all components - make sure each component works

- FIXME Copying the secrets folder everywhere is not good practice; might need to look into docker-compose instead of Dockerfile because volume mounting with relative path doesn't work for Dockerfile

- FIXME preprocessing.py is kinda slow - the last part... parhaps save locally then bulk upload?
